    "# Day One: Introduction to Python and Python for Data Analysis\n",
    "Python is an extremly useful and powerful programming langauge, which has allowed it to become one of the most used langauges by developers. One of the main reasons for this is that it is comparatively easy to understand and learn when compared to other languages. There are also several library packages that can be added, which are particularly useful for data analysis.\n",
